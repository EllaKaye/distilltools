There are two ways to apply a custom syntax highlighting scheme to a Distill site or blog:

1.  Apply it site-wide by adding a `theme` key to the top-level of your `_site.yml` configuration file (assuming the theme file is in your root directory):

    ``` {.yaml}
    output:
      distill::distill_article:
        highlight: highlighting.theme
    ```

At least, that *should* work, but isn't for the author at the time of writing. There is an open [issue](https://github.com/rstudio/distill/issues/370) about this. 

2.  Apply to an individual article by adding a `theme` key to your article's YAML front-matter, using the full path (assuming that the `.theme` file is in the site root directory), e.g.:

    ``` {.yaml}
    ---
    title: "My Highlighting Theme"
    output:
      distill::distill_article:
        highlight: /Users/USER/WEBSITE/highlighting.theme
    ---
    ```

The second option allows for you to apply your theme to individual articles, while using a different theme for the rest of your site. Note that this is only possible for stand-alone articles within a website --- you cannot apply a theme to individual blog posts *only*.
